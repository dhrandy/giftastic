## Description

This is the sixth assignment for the UNCC Coding Bootcamp in NC.

In this assignment, we were required to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of our choice.

## Instructions

Enter a tool into the search box. As you enter tools into the search box, buttons will appear below with the tool entered and gifs related to that tool will appear above. If you are not sure of a tool to search then feel free to select one of the already populated buttons on the page.

The theme is Home Improvement to inspire you to enter a tool term, but feel free to search any items that is of interest to you. Just to warn you, most will come back tool related.
